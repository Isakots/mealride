I'm creating this webapplication for a subject, called Project Laboratory, at the university.

During this project I will get to know the Spring framework and related technologies like 
- the Maven build automation tool, 
- the database ORM technologies like JPA, Hibernate, EclipseLink
- the Thymeleaf template engine 
- the AJAX frontend technology
- Bootstrap and JQuery to create frontend design
- and ofc a part of the Spring framework itself, which is really huge
